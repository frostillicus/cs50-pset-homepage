                    of the Moon. It's probably from an asteroid that collided with the Moon, but it
                    could also be a huge, underground alien base!</li>

                        href="https://www.space.com/20790-eugene-cernan-astronaut-biography.html">carved
                        his daughter's initials</a> on the surface of the moon. Since
                    there's basically no erosion on the Moon, the initials will still be there
                    many
                    years from now.</li>
                <li>Monday is named after the Moon ("Moon's day"). It was originally the
                    Anglo-Saxon
                    word "<a target="_blank"

                </li>
                <li>Due to tidal locking, one side of the Moon always faces the Earth. However,
                    since the orbit is not circular, the Moon gradually rocks back and forth
                    (called
                    "libration"), allowing us to see <a target="_blank"

                        59% of its surface</a> from the Earth.</li>
                <li>The Moon was probably created when another planet <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.psi.edu/epo/moon/moon.html">collided with the
                        Earth</a>
                    billions of years ago. Some of the material was blasted into orbit around
                    the
                    Earth, later accumulating into a single large body.</li>
                <li>The Moon is also known as "Luna" and is the <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/why-do-we-still-believe-in-lunacy-during-a-full-moon">origin
                        of words like "lunacy"</a>. This is based on the myth that the Moon
                    (particularly the full Moon) affects people's behavior.</li>
                <li>The Moon is about as wide as Australia.</li>
                <li>Illustrations often portray the Moon as being very close to Earth, but in
                    reality it's very far away. The actual scale is shown below. Image credit:
